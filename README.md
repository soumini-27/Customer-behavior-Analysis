# Customer Behavior Analysis

## Summary
An end-to-end customer behavior analytics project using SQL, Python, and Power BI to analyze purchasing patterns, customer segments, and revenue drivers.

---

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior data to uncover insights related to purchasing habits, subscription status, demographic segments, and product performance.

The goal is to transform raw customer-level data into meaningful business insights through structured data preparation, analysis, and visualization. The final output is an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to support data-driven decision-making.

## Problem Statement
Businesses often lack clear visibility into how different customer segments behave and contribute to revenue. Without this understanding, it becomes difficult to:

- Identify high-value customer segments  
- Improve subscription adoption and retention  
- Optimize product and category strategies  

This project addresses these challenges by analyzing customer behavior across demographics, categories, and subscription status.

- **Records:** ~3,900 customers
- **Key attributes:**
  - Customer demographics (age group, gender)
  - Subscription status
  - Product category
  - Shipping type
  - Purchase amount
  - Customer review ratings

---

## Tools and Technologies
- **SQL:** Data cleaning, transformation, and analytical queries  
- **Python:** Exploratory data analysis (Jupyter Notebook)  
- **Power BI:** Data modeling, DAX measures, and dashboard development  
- **Git & GitHub:** Version control and portfolio publishing  

---

## Methods
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Handled missing and inconsistent values  
   - Validated data types and ranges  
   - Prepared analysis-ready datasets  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Analyzed customer distributions and purchasing patterns  
   - Identified trends across demographics and categories  

3. **Visualization & Reporting**
   - Built KPIs for customer count, average spend, and ratings  
   - Created category, age group, and subscription-level visuals  
   - Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard  

---

## Executive Summary
This project analyzes customer behavior to understand how demographics, subscription status, and product preferences influence purchasing outcomes.

By combining SQL-based data preparation, Python exploratory analysis, and Power BI visualization, the project provides a clear view of customer segments and revenue drivers. The dashboard highlights opportunities to improve customer retention, increase subscription adoption, and optimize category performance.

---

## Key Insights
- A majority of customers are **non-subscribers**, indicating strong potential to grow recurring revenue  
- **Clothing** is the top-performing category in both revenue and sales volume  
- **Young adult and middle-aged customers** contribute the largest share of total revenue  
- Average customer ratings indicate moderate satisfaction, suggesting opportunities for engagement improvement  
- Revenue is concentrated within a small number of customer segments and categories  

---

## Dashboard / Output
The Power BI dashboard provides:
- High-level KPIs (number of customers, average purchase amount, average rating)
- Customer segmentation by subscription status and demographics
- Revenue and sales analysis by product category
- Behavioral insights by age group
